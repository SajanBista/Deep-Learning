Day 1:
Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression
This program applies logistic regression to predict whether a customer will churn based on features like customer demographics, service usage, and payment details. Logistic regression is used here as the output variable (churn) is binary: the customer either churns (1) or does not churn (0).

Program Breakdown:
1. Importing Required Libraries: import pandas as pd
2. import numpy as np
3. from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
4. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
5. from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
6. from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
7.  Explanation:
    * pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
    * numpy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
    * train_test_split is used to split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
    * StandardScaler standardizes features to have zero mean and unit variance.
    * LogisticRegression is the machine learning model we use for classification.
    * accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, and classification_report are used for evaluating the performance of the model.

2. Loading the Dataset: url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv'
3. data = pd.read_csv(url)
4.  Explanation:
    * The program loads the Telco Customer Churn dataset from a URL.
    * pd.read_csv(url) reads the dataset from the given URL (replace with your local path if needed).

3. Checking for Missing Values: data.isnull().sum()
4.  Explanation:
    * data.isnull().sum() checks if there are any missing values in the dataset.
    * This function will output the count of missing values in each column, which helps to identify columns with incomplete data.

4. Dropping Unnecessary Columns: data.drop(columns=['customerID'], axis=1, inplace=True)
5.  Explanation:
    * customerID is dropped as it is not necessary for predicting customer churn.
    * We use the drop() function to remove this column from the dataset.

5. Converting Categorical Variables to Numerical Values: data = pd.get_dummies(data, drop_first=True)
6.  Explanation:
    * Logistic regression requires numerical values, so categorical columns like gender, contract, payment method need to be converted.
    * pd.get_dummies() converts categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables (i.e., it creates binary columns for each category).
    * drop_first=True drops the first category to avoid the dummy variable trap, which helps to prevent multicollinearity.

6. Splitting the Data into Features (X) and Target (y): X = data.drop(columns=['Churn_Yes'])  # Features
7. y = data['Churn_Yes']  # Target variable (1 if churned, 0 if not)
8.  Explanation:
    * X contains the features (all columns except Churn_Yes).
    * y contains the target variable, which is Churn_Yes (whether a customer has churned or not).

7. Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
8.  Explanation:
    * The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
    * test_size=0.2 indicates that 20% of the data is used for testing, while 80% is used for training.
    * random_state=42 ensures reproducibility of the results, i.e., the same random split is obtained each time.

8. Standardizing the Features: scaler = StandardScaler()
9. X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
10. X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
11.  Explanation:
    * Logistic regression performs better when the features are standardized, especially when the features have different units and scales.
    * StandardScaler standardizes the data by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
    * fit_transform() is used to fit the scaler to the training data and transform it.
    * transform() is used to apply the same transformation to the test data (without fitting it again).

9. Training the Logistic Regression Model: model = LogisticRegression()
10. model.fit(X_train, y_train)
11.  Explanation:
    * A LogisticRegression model is created and fitted to the training data (X_train and y_train).
    * This step involves finding the best-fitting parameters (weights) for the logistic regression model based on the training data.

10. Making Predictions on the Test Set: y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
11.  Explanation:
    * The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set (X_test).
    * The predictions (y_pred) indicate whether each customer in the test set is predicted to churn (1) or not churn (0).

11. Evaluating the Model: accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
12. print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
13.  Explanation:
    * accuracy_score() computes the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted values (y_pred) with the actual values (y_test).
    * The accuracy is printed, showing how well the model performs overall.

12. Confusion Matrix: print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
13. print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
14.  Explanation:
    * The confusion matrix is printed using confusion_matrix(), which shows the performance of the classification model.
    * It displays four values:
        * True Positives (TP): Correct predictions of churn.
        * False Positives (FP): Incorrect predictions of churn.
        * True Negatives (TN): Correct predictions of no churn.
        * False Negatives (FN): Incorrect predictions of no churn.

13. Classification Report: print("\nClassification Report:")
14. print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
15.  Explanation:
    * The classification_report() provides a detailed performance report, including metrics such as:
        * Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions in all positive predictions.
        * Recall: The proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model.
        * F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
        * Support: The number of actual occurrences of each class in the test data.

Real-World Application:
Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry:
In the telecom industry, churn prediction plays a crucial role in identifying customers who are likely to leave the company. By using logistic regression, telecom companies can predict the probability of churn based on various customer attributes, such as:
* Customer Demographics: Age, gender, income level, etc.
* Service Usage Patterns: How often a customer uses the service, which plans they are subscribed to, etc.
* Payment Information: Frequency of late payments, payment methods, etc.
* Contract Information: The type of contract, contract duration, etc.
Once the model is trained and deployed, the company can take preventive actions to retain customers. These actions might include:
* Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Offering discounts, better plans, or loyalty rewards to customers at high risk of churning.
* Improving Customer Service: Identifying pain points or issues that might be causing dissatisfaction and addressing them proactively.
* Customer Segmentation: Tailoring products and services to different customer segments based on their likelihood to churn.

Business Impact:
By predicting customer churn, businesses can:
* Reduce Revenue Loss: Identify at-risk customers and take action to retain them before they churn.
* Optimize Marketing Spend: Focus marketing efforts on high-risk customers instead of spending on all customers equally.
* Improve Customer Experience: Address specific issues faced by customers, leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention.
This predictive model can be used in various industries, including:
* Telecom: To prevent customer churn by offering personalized services.
* Banking: To predict customers likely to close accounts and offer retention strategies.
* Retail and E-commerce: To predict customers likely to stop purchasing and offer incentives to keep them engaged.
In summary, logistic regression for customer churn prediction is a powerful tool for businesses to understand their customers better, reduce churn, and improve retention rates by implementing targeted actions based on data-driven insights.
